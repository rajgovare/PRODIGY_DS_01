# Retail Sales Data Analysis - Internship Task

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior. The dataset includes information such as transaction IDs, customer demographics, product categories, sales quantity, and total sales amounts. The goal of this analysis is to visualize patterns and trends in the data, which can assist in business decision-making.

Through this project, we aim to:
1. Understand which product categories are generating the most revenue.
2. Analyze the age distribution of customers.
3. Examine sales distribution by gender.

## Methodology/Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning
- We begin by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- There is no null value exists.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics** are computed for continuous variables such as `Age` and `Total Amount` to understand basic trends.
- Data distributions are visualized using advanced bar charts and histograms.

### 3. Advanced Visualizations
- **Bar Chart for Product Categories**: Shows total sales for each product category, providing insight into customer preferences.
- **Histogram for Age Distribution**: Displays the distribution of customer ages, highlighting which age groups are the most active buyers.
- **Gender Breakdown (Optional)**: Visualizes total sales broken down by customer gender, giving insights into gender-based sales patterns.

### 4. Insights & Reporting
- Key insights are extracted based on the visualizations, highlighting top-performing categories, customer age patterns, and gender sales distribution.
- These insights are summarized and presented to offer actionable conclusions for retail businesses.

## Requirements
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
